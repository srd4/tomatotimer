- correction module just has functions to solve the non-registered/unconsistent time problem the script had.
- objectcreation creates pom objects.
- pomcounts has functions to count time spent pomodoros and pomodoros.
- stringmanagement has different functions to modify and edit descriptions and words in pom objects.
- dateparsing has functions for working with, modify, edit, load and plot dates of pom objects.
- getData has different functions for obtaining certain quantities and values of the script
- gsheet now updates tomatohistory file on a only spread sheet saved in my google account in drive.

Ideas:
- Date reports about:
 - Average time of the day I do pomodoros, to see how it changes when in college.
- Progress is motivating. I was thinking about making even more ways of showing the data about progress.
- Third .py file that has ways of working with data.py to give me data reports or something.
- Make the script tell me I need to rest longer when after 4 pomodoros in a row.
- When finished a book or any particular activity, let the program know that is finished so it doesn't keep showing it to me as recommendation.
- I can open the file from the script.
- Not showing total minutes but total ours of a given activity.
- Program suggesting me to rest after I did four sets of the same thing in the same day.
- Make the dic command not only show amount of poms but also time invested on each code/activity.
- Single file (maybe txt file) that loads configurations for the program to work, like poms durations.
- Loads too slow at the beggining.
- Average from last week.
- I have to graph the times of the day I have done pomodoros the most, they're probably when productivity is at my maximum.
